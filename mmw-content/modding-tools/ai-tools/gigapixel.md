**Gigapixel** is an AI image upscaling app developed by Topaz Labs, capable of [[guides/textures/index|upscaling Morrowind textures]].[^1][^2]

## Purchasing Gigapixel

Although Gigapixel offers an unlimited free trial, purchasing the software is necessary to make practical use of it due to the 'Topaz Labs' watermark to added to all processed images by the trial version.[^3]

Gigapixel offers three versions:

- **Gigapixel 7** (personal): The full personal version of Gigapixel.
- **Gigapixel Pro** (commercial): Intended for commercial use, it offers advanced features over the personal version but is significantly more expensive and unnecessary for modding.
- **Gigapixel Trial**: A full trial of Gigapixel 7 with no time limit, with the caveat that it adds a 'Topaz Labs' watermark to all images.

## Texture Size

Morrowind can only handle textures which have dimensions in powers of two, e.g., 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048 and so on. Accordingly, textures can be upscaled 2x, 4x and even 6x their original size with Gigapixel.
