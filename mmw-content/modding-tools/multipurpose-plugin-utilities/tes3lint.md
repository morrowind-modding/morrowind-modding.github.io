**Tes3lint** is a command-line tool by John Moonsugar for checking plugins for potential problems.

In addition to detecting common problems which are cleaned automatically by other tools, including Moonsugar's other tool [[tes3cmd|Tes3cmd]], tes3lint's features include:

- Check for implicit dependency on Tribunal/Bloodmoon functions without having them as a master.
- Display duplicate/modified INFO records.
- Detect whether INFO records have had their IDs changed
- Find scripts that do not utilize `MenuMode`.
- Check whether Author/Description/Version fields are missing from plugin header.



## Usage

Like Moonsugar's other tool [[tes3cmd|Tes3cmd]], it is also written in Perl. However, unlike the former it requires that Perl itself is installed. Tes3lint is run via the command-line, but can also be run through [[wrye-mash|Wrye Mash Polemos Fork]] which features tes3lint support.
