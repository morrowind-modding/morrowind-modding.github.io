**TES Bookmaker** is a simple text editor for creating Morrowind books, capable of converting plain text into Morrowind's bespoke HTML format and featuring a <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> with buttons for text-formatting.

The original tool developed by Дарин (Darin) is in Russian, but an English language version by MassiveJuice is available.

## Usage

The editor works by applying Morrowind-specific HTML markup to plain text.

Plain text can be entered in the left-hand panel and, by pressing the green arrow, gets formatted with HTML in the right-hand panel. Further editing can be done in the right-hand panel by manually typing, or by using the UI buttons. These include:

- **New Line**: adds HTML `<BR>{:html}` tag to indicate a new line
- **Center Text**: adds HTML `<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">{:html}`.
- **Left-Align Text**: adds HTML `<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">{:html}`
- **Insert Image**: Pop-up to specify an image's source, width and height.
- **A**: Pop-up to specify font name, size and color.

Once finished, the marked-up text is ready to be entered into a [book object](https://tes3cs.pages.dev/objects/object-types/book) in the Construction Set.
