**TES Bookmaker** is a simple text editor for creating Morrowind books, capable of converting plain text into Morrowind's bespoke HTML format and featuring a <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> with buttons for text-formatting.

## Translation

Although the UI is in Russian, it is fully capable of rendering English and other languages, and its simple UI does not require knowledge of the language.

Below are English translations of the four UI elements which are in Russian:

1. **Название** = "Name"
2. **Моя книга** = "My Book"
3. **Автор** = "Author"
4. **Джон Доу** = "John Doe"

The remaining UI buttons are symbols which do not require translation.
