**Abot's Deleveler** is a utility for converting all [[guides/leveled-lists/index|Leveled Lists]] in a plugin to potentially spawn at level 1 - so called 'deleveling' - through the use of [[tes3cmd|Tes3cmd]] BAT and Perl scripts.



## Usage

1. Double-click the `tes3cmd_multipatch.bat` file to generate a `multipatch.esp`, which merges the leveled lists of your active mods.
2. Double-click the `delev.bat` file to create a `delev.esp` from your active mod list. This should be loaded after the `multipatch.esp`.

## History

The utility was developed by Abot in 2018 as a personal request by OffWorldDevil (previously known as 'SpaceDevo'). OffWorldDevil later uploaded the utility to Nexus Mods.[^1]
