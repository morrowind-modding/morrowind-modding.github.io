**Live Book Editing** is an MWSE mod by C3pa which enables edits made to books or scrolls in a text editor to be previewed live in-game.

## Usage

Books and scrolls to be edited are loaded from `Data files\booktext.txt` and `Data files\scrolltext.txt` respectively, and are opened with the following hotkeys:

|   Action    |            Hotkey             |
| :---------: | :---------------------------: |
|  Open book  | <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> |
| Open scroll | <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> |

After saving edits made to either text file while Morrowind is running in the background,<sup>\[_[[inline-citation-needed|Citation needed]]_\]</sup> changes will be displayed after switching window to display Morrowind and pressing the relevant book or scroll hotkey.

This behavior can be altered through the mod's <abbr title="mod configuration menu">MCM</abbr> to instead place a persistent book or scroll in your inventory with which to preview book edits. The mod detects if the player does not have either item in their inventory and will automatically add it. Alternatively, this can be bound to a hotkey through the MCM.
