**Sniff** is a batch processing tool for modifying `NIF` files for _Morrowind_, _Oblivion_, _Skyrim_, _Fallout 3_, _Fallout New Vegas_ and _Fallout 4_.

In addition to its built-in batch processing functions, it also features the ability to convert `NIF` files to and from JSON (akin to [[tes3conv|Tes3conv]]). This allows for, alternatively, making batch edits to `NIF` files using text replacer tools such as [Mass Text Replacer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/masstextreplace/) or [GrepWin](https://github.com/stefankueng/grepWin).

Some functions of Sniff are built into xEdit.[^1] However, it is unknown if these work in xEdit's view-only Morrowind fork, [[tes3view|TES3View]].
