## General Practices for File Naming

![[contributing/manual-of-style/index#^3085e6|clean right]]

- Use only standard ASCII alphanumeric characters in file and directory names.
- Lowercase only.
- No special characters, such as `?`, `%`,`#`, `/`, `|`, `:`, `;`, `•`.
- Use `-`hyphens`-` instead of spaces to separate words. These are recognized by search engines as a substitute for spaces.
	- Do not use `_`underscores`_` for spaces. These are generally not recognized by search engines so can negatively affect SEO.[^1]

## Naming Images and Videos

In addition to following general file naming practices, image filenames should be short and descriptive of the content of the image.

For example, `my-new-black-kitten.jpg` is better than `IMG00023.JPG` for a picture of a black kitten. Descriptive image filenames give search engines clues as to the subject matter of an image. This is supplementary to the addition of descriptive alt-text to images, which is the most important attribute for providing metadata about images for search engines.[^2]
