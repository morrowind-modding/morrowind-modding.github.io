## Writing Style

### Tone

The Morrowind Modding Wiki differs from other wikis in that it uses an instructional tone for much of its content ‚Äê something that most wikis avoid. 

That's not to say that we don't use wiki style too. Many articles are general reference, not just tutorials.

TO-DO

- tone
	- instructional tone and 'technical writing'
- callouts
- impartiality
- verifiable
- accessibility
- paragraphs
	- single sentence opener
	- 1:3:1 writing rhythm
- redundancy
	- transclusions
- media
	- images
	- videos
- downloads
- first-person tone

## Transclusions

This allows for [[redundancy]] within the wiki, wherein an important piece of data (such as a table or a contents list), which must appear on multiple pages, can be stored in just one note. When updates are made to the data, only the original note needs to be edited; all pages where that data has been embedded will be updated automatically. 

This is the same principle as [Wikipedia 'Templates'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates). However, it has been renamed because ['Templates' in Obsidian serve a different function](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates).
