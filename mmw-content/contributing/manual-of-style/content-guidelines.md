## Writing Style

### Tone

The Morrowind Modding Wiki differs from other wikis in that it uses an instructional tone for much of its content ‐ something that most wikis avoid. 

That's not to say that we don't use wiki style too. Many articles are general reference, not just tutorials.

TO-DO

- tone
	- instructional tone and 'technical writing'
- callouts
- impartiality
- verifiable
- accessibility
- paragraphs
	- single sentence opener
	- 1:3:1 writing rhythm
- redundancy
	- transclusions
- media
	- images
	- videos
- downloads
- first-person tone

## Transclusions

This allows for [[redundancy]] within the wiki, wherein an important piece of data (such as a table or a contents list), which must appear on multiple pages, can be stored in just one note. When updates are made to the data, only the original note needs to be edited; all pages where that data has been embedded will be updated automatically. 

This is the same principle as [Wikipedia 'Templates'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates). However, it has been renamed because ['Templates' in Obsidian serve a different function](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates).
