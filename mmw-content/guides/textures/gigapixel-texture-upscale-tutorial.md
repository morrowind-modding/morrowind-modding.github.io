This step-by-step tutorial describes a workflow for upscaling textures with AI, through the use of [[gigapixel|Gigapixel AI]]. Other AI upscaling tools such as [[real-esrgan|ESRGAN]] can be used instead of Gigapixel, but the instructions here will assume usage of the latter.

### Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. Convert textures in bulk from TGM/DDS format to PNG, ready to be upscaled.
2. Upscale textures using Gigapixel 7
3. Optionally generate normal maps and specular maps using [[normalmap-generator|NormalmapGenerator]].
4. Convert the upscaled textures back to the appropriate DDS format using [[nvidia-texture-tools|NVIDIA Texture Tools 3]] via Python batch scripts

### Prerequisites

#### Gigapixel 7

Gigapixel 7 (personal) is required. Theoretically the trial version will suffice, but any output textures processed by it will have a watermark applied to them. Gigapixel Pro will also work, but it is more than is necessary.

#### XnConvert

[XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/) will be used to convert the original textures from DDS or TGM into DDS format in bulk. Equivalent batch image converters can be used instead, but the tutorial will assume usage of XnConvert.

#### Python

This is required in order to run BAT files used for processing the textures through NTT3.
