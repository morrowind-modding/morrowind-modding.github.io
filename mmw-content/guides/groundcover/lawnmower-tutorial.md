This tutorial covers how to use [The Lawnmower](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53034) tool to clean [[groundcover]] mods of excess grass - specifically, grass which clips through other objects.

### Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. Run The Lawnmower on a groundcover plugin
2. Compare a groundcover plugin against multiple mods ('chaining')
3. Understand how to use the 'autoclean' plugins to increase the accuracy of The Lawnmower

### Prerequisites

> [!Info|right wsmall txt-s] Installing Python
> Whilst it may seem daunting, installation is in fact unremarkable and straightforward on most platforms.[^1] 
> 
> See Python [BeginnersGuide / Download](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) for help

In addition to downloading The Lawnmower, the tool also requires that you have [Tes3conv](https://github.com/Greatness7/tes3conv) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
