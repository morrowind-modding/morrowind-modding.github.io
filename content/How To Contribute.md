In order to contribute to the wiki, you must have two things:

1. A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
2. The [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app 
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   *nix users, feel free to grab the above applications from your local package manager instead.

We assume for the sake of this document that you already all three of these. We have done what we can to minimize interaction with Git and we will walk you through necessary steps to use it. We also hope that you will very much enjoy using Obsidian.
# Fork the Repository

1. Go to the [wiki repository](https://github.com/morrowind-modding/wiki)
2. Click `Fork`, then `Create Fork`:
   ![[Pasted image 20240210185412.png]]![[Pasted image 20240210185439.png]]
   Now you have your own unique copy of the entire repository which you can change however you like and even rehost. Note that over time the repository may grow to be fairly large. 
   
   NOTE: Developers may build the site locally with the following `npm` command:
   `npm i` 
   `npx quartz build --serve`
   
   You will be brought to your newly created copy of the wiki's github. Get your repo's url by clicking `Code`, then `HTTPS`, then the clipboard icon.
   
   Stash the URL somewhere safe, as you will need it later. Or, if you simply want a copy of the wiki for your personal Obsidian vault - you're done! ![[Pasted image 20240210190215.png]]


# Get A Personal Access Token

In order to make changes to the wiki's GitHub through Obsidian, you must give it a special key that says it has permission from you to do so first.

1. Log into your Github account and open your profile. Then go to Settings. You can open your profile from any part of the GitHub site by clicking your profile picture in the upper right corner of the page:![[Pasted image 20240210183517.png]]
   ![[Pasted image 20240210183545.png]]
   2. Go to `developer settings`, then `Personal Access Tokens`, and select `Token (Classic)`: ![[Pasted image 20240210183812.png]]![[Pasted image 20240210183916.png]]
      On this final menu, select `Generate a Personal Access Token`:
      ![[Screenshot_20240210_184211.png]]
      
      On this page you name your key and set its expiration date. We recommend doing a `Custom` expiration for one year from the date you are creating the key. This is as long as GitHub will allow them to live. Then, make sure to click the checkbox next to `repo`. Finally, click `Generate Token` at the bottom of the page. Please take special note of the fact that you will not be able to see your personal access token again after creating it - leave the page open until you've configured Obsidian!

# Set Up Obsidian

## Install Git for Obsidian

Now you just need to hook your personal access token and repository fork into Obsidian itself. 
1. Open Obsidian and click the settings gear in the bottom-left.
![[Pasted image 20240210191739.png]]
2. Go to `Community Plugins`, then `Browse`. Search for `Git`.
   ![[Pasted image 20240210191953.png]]
   Select the first result, hit `Install`, then `Enable`.
   ![[Screenshot_20240210_192008.png]]
   
## Clone the Repository
   1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `CTRL+P`
   2. Type in clone, and select `Clone an existing repo`
      ![[Screenshot_20240210_192157.png]]
3. Paste in your repository URL in the following format:
`https://<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git
    Replace `<PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your previously generated key, and your username in place of `<USERNAME>`:
   ![[Screenshot_20240210_192307.png]]
   Pick a name for the folder, and leave the second box about `Clone depth` blank - simply press enter. Now the wiki is installed inside of obsidian, and you can make edits to your local copy of it. Let's start by sending over this very document!
   
   
## Editing Guide
   Pick where your document should go first. Most contributor content should go under `Guides`, but if you're making edits to a specific project, then use that folder instead. Feel free to create new folders if you feel your document necessitates it.
   
   Text documents should be placed at the author's discretion, with any assets (ESM, DDS, pictures, videos, etc) placed inside of The matching folder under `Assets`. See the Morrowind Interiors Project guide for an example:
   
   ![[Pasted image 20240210194829.png]]
   
   You can drag any files your document depends on right into Obsidian and place them into this folder. This helps keep the wiki easy to navigate. 

## Send It Home
   
   Once you're done editing:
   1. Make sure the right sidebar is open
   2. Select the source control view (if it's not visible you may need to drag the sidebar a bit further out)
    ![[Pasted image 20240210195200.png]]

Your changes will be listed here - click the back arrow to revert them, or the plus sign to `Stage` them. This simply means you are preparing to send them to github. Take this opportunity make sure you recognize everything you added or changed before staging your changes. Mistakes can be made!


![[Pasted image 20240210195651.png]]

This is where your commit message will be written. This is simply meant to be an informative note regarding the changes you made. Once that's done, click the buttons above in the listed order. Do not click button `1` if you manually staged individual files as described above.

You're all done editing! The only thing left for you the creator to do is submit it for review. Go back to your fork on GitHub. You should see a message similar to the one below; click `Contribute`, then `Open Pull Request`.

![[Pasted image 20240210200208.png]]
A summary of your changes will appear. If you already know what's been done, then keep it simple - Just press open pull request. ![[Pasted image 20240210200259.png]]

We promise, this is the last page. This is your opportunity to explain your changes, what they do, and why they exist. Don't be afraid to say whatever you feel is appropriate - be elaborate, be concise, but please explain what you did somehow or another. if you wish, check `Allow edits by maintainers`, to allow the core team to make changes to your Pull Request whilst it's being reviewed.


![[Pasted image 20240210200438.png]]

Reviews may be quick or not, but, please do what you are able to communicate with the team regarding any questions or issues that may come up during review. Pull Requests that are abandoned after 30 days will be assumed to be left in the entirely hands of the team and will be handled according to their judgment.

If all goes well, you are now done with the entire process. If you are ever lost regarding any step, you may refer to this document or reach out to the team on [MMC](https://discord.gg/yDjWBrGW)
