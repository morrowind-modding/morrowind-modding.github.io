You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```md
First Header | Second Header
------------ | ------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```

First Header | Second Header
------------ | ------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

---

```md
Tables can be justified with a colon | Another example with a long title
:----------------|-------------:
because of the `:` | these will be justified
```

Tables can be justified with a colon | Another example with a long title
:----------------|-------------:
because of the `:` | these will be justified

If you put links in tables, they will work, but if you use Piped Links, the pipe must be escaped with a `\` to prevent it being read as a table element.

```md
First Header | Second Header
------------ | ------------
[[Format your notes\|Formatting]]	|  [[Callouts\|Callouts]]
```

First Header | Second Header
------------ | ------------
[[Format your notes\|Formatting]]	|  [[Callout\|Callouts]]
