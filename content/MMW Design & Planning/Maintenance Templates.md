## About

Maintenance templates are callouts used to mark a page (or a section within a page) as having issues which require editorial attention, in order to conform to MMW standards.

Wikipedia and other wiki-style sites use maintenance templates extensively to notify editors of what work needs to be done on a page. Ideally, issues should be fixed in the first instance. However, not every editor is qualified to undertake the work required (which may require advanced knowledge of a subject). 

When an issue cannot be fixed immediately, adding a maintenance template ensures the issue is identified and can be addressed later.

### Usage

These are [Obsidian Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) - see the help docs for how to insert a template.

Maintenance Templates should be placed at the top of a page or, if pertaining only to a section of a page, directly below the relevant section heading.

In most cases the content of the template should not be modified, and only inserted as-is. The exception is with templates which require input as to whether the issue pertains to an 'article', 'category' or 'tag'.
