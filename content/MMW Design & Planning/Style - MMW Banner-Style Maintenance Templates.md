## About

Wikipedia and other wiki-style sites commonly place banner-style maintenance templates on pages which have one or more issues that need addressing. These templates highlight what issues need addressing and invite contributors to contribute to correct these issues. For example, Wikipedia uses [Wikipedia:Template index/Disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_index/Disputes) and [Wikipedia:Template index/Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_index/Cleanup). Maintenance templates can be placed at the top of an article, or at the top of a section within an article. 

>[!figure] ![[MMW_Style_WikipediaBanner.png]] 
> 
> Example of a Wikipedia 'cleanup' maintenance template. 

Fandom Wikis often implement these templates in stylized ways which reference character quotes, and/or events from the fictional universe the wiki documents. 

- For example, the Star Wars wiki [Wookiepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) uses stylized maintenance templates extensively -- [see here for their full list](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Maintenance_templates)

> [!figure] ![[MMW_Style_WookiepediaBanner.png]] 
> 
> Example of a stylized maintenance template used by Wookiepedia. 

To add flair to the wiki, custom Morrowind-themed maintenance templates can be created, using Obsidian-style [Callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts). Callout icons could be images of the character whom the quote is from, or one of many icons used in Morrowind (e.g., spell, disease, skill, faction icons etc.)

---

## Morrowind-Themed Maintenance Templates 

 A list of draft maintenance templates, sorted by category. Where more than one potential option is given for what the final maintenance template could be, the callout will specify if it is "option 1", "2" and so on.

> [!figure] Wikipedia Example:

> ![[MMW_Style_Wikipedia_Categorization_01.png]] 
> 
> Wikipedia "[\{{Uncategorized}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Uncategorized)" maintenance template

### Article Categorization Issues

For pages that are placed in an incorrect category, or directly in `/content`.

- E.g., a guide on creating [[Guides/Patches/index|Patches]] is placed in `/content/Guides` instead of `/content/Guides/Patches`.

### Article Tag Issues 

Maintenance templates For the following issues:

- An article is missing tags. 
- An article contains tags that are not relevant to its content.

> 
> #### Missing Tags: 
> 
>> [!warning]+  _"The letter that preceded you mentioned you were born under a certain sign. And what would that be?"_

### Category Maintenance 

Maintenance templates for subject 'categories' (i.e., the subfolders contained within `/content`). Each subfolder contains an `index.md` file that acts as a folder-page for the category, so any 'category maintenance' templates should be inserted there.

> [!info]+ Draft Ideas -- Category Maintenance:
> 
> #### Underpopulated Category:
> 
> > [!warning]+ _"Seen any elves? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA"_
> > 
> > This category could be populated with more articles. Please help out by contributing written articles. 
> > 
> > \*_replace icon with generic Nord face_ 
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Overpopulated Category:
> 
> > [!warning]+ _"Candy, candy -- he makes so much! Uncle Sweetshare has a magic touch!"_
> > 
> > This category is overpopulated. Please consider splitting it into smaller subcategories.
> > 
> > \*_replace icon with Uncle Sweetshare_
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Category Undergoing Maintenance:
> 
> For categories that are being reorganized.
> 
> > [!warning]+ _"Where is that slave? Here not long ago."_
> > 
> > Articles in this category are currently being recategorized. Be aware when adding new articles to this category while this message is up. If you wish to know who is working on the category, please consult the Discussions tab on Github for discussion on this index page.

---

### Redlinks

Redlinks are placeholder links to wiki articles that have not yet been created. E.g., if the article on Blender had not yet been created, you could create a redlink in your animation tutorial as a placeholder to reference it like so: `[[Modding Tools/3D Modeling Software & Tools/Blender|Blender]]` which would be displayed as `Blender`

> [!info]+ Draft Ideas -- Redlinks
> 
> #### Article Contains Too Many Redlinks
> 
> > [!warning]+ _"Why walk when you can ride?"_
> > 
> > This article contains an excess of redlinks. Attention is requested to create new articles from these links.
> > 
> > \*_replace icon with Dunmer Silt Strider Pilot_

### Relevance

> > 
> > \*_replace icon with "Have a Fishy Stick!" image._
> 
> ---
> 
> #### Topic Covered Elsewhere
> 
> > [!warning]+ _"Greetings, outlander. Don't I know you from somewhere?"_
> > 
> > This article/section repeats information already covered by external sources. It could benefit from being condensed and directing readers to those sources where applicable. Consult the Github Discussion for more information.
> > 
> > \*_replace icon with generic Dunmer_


repeating information from external sources - this article about `[non-morrowind-specific tool/subject]` repeats information already explained on `[external tool/subject website, e.g., Gimp user guides`

### Sources

> #### Lacking Sources

> >
> > \*_replace icon with ALMSIVI symbol or Vivec_

---

### Tone

Most wikis use an impartial, encyclopedic tone. It would be sensible for MMW to follow this convention, as it avoids lending certain mods, modding methods or modding tools an undue bias. If any content should be recommended over others, sources should be cited. An encyclopedic tone makes maintaining a consistent tone and style of writing easier; humor is subjective.

> [!info] Draft Ideas -- Tone Issues
> 
> #### Informal Tone

> > [!warning]+ _"Where's your uniform?"_
> >
> > This article, or a section of this article, may not be written in the formal tone expected of an encyclopedia entry.
