Win95/98/2000/Me, 128 MB RAM, and hard drive space for game data files. It is recommended that it be run at 1024x768 or higher. 

Direct3D is used for all 3D rendering. Since the Construction Set renders in a window, only those video cards that support accelerated window rendering are recommended. It also uses hardware acceleration for bilinear filtering, transforms, and lighting.

A 3D accelerated video card is not necessary to run the Construction Set, but it is highly recommended.


You can obtain better performance from the rendering a few ways:
1.	Buy a better video card.

2.	Decrease the size of the render window.

3.	Turn Mip-Maps off in Properties.

4.	Turn down the render distance in Properties.

5.	Make sure the fogging option is OFF.

6.	Buy a better video card.



If you have done a Maximum install of the Construction Set, you may notice it (and Morrowind the game) take longer to load. This is because both programs will use the raw version of the art, instead of compressed artwork. This takes longer to load.
