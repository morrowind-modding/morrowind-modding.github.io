# Welcome to the Morrowind Modding Wiki

**MMW** is a community wiki aiming to bring together over twenty years of Morrowind modding knowledge.

Contributions are always welcome and appreciated. Read [[how-to-contribute|How to Contribute]] to get started using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and publish content to the wiki. For content and writing guidelines, review the [[contributing/manual-of-style/index|Manual of Style]]. 
As development so far has been focused mainly on designing the website, the wiki itself currently lacks content. Whether you're an experienced modmaker or are just starting out, we'd love to see your contributions. If you'd like to discuss the wiki or ask for help, drop by the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7uBsMyw8yU) or use the comments section at the bottom of each page.

Completed articles so far include:
- [[branching-dialogue-tutorial|Branching Dialogue Tutorial]]

- [[morrowind-interiors-project|Morrowind Interiors Project]]
