Lua is a very small and feature-light programming language. Compared to several other programming languages, there are very few built-in functionalities and data structures. This makes it much easier to pick up the language, but it can also lead to repetitive code and result in rebuilding the wheel several times.

The most comprehensive (freely available) Lua guide is the first edition of the [Programming in Lua (PIL)](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) book. Although, it is not without it's faults. Namely:
- PIL is designed for Lua 5.0, while MWSE and openmw both use modified versions of Lua 5.1. This means some sections of PIL are outdated, and that PIL doesn't cover all of the features you'll have at your disposal when developing Lua mods.
- Some parts of the book can be rather terse and/or highly abstract.
- The book does not contain very many examples.

The goals of these pages will be to fill in some of the gaps in PIL book.
